        <pre>
            Social media does some pretty great things, but it 
            doesnt come without its flaws.Some of these are:
        </pre>
        <ul>
            <li>Viruses</li>
            <li>Cyber Bullying</li>
            <li>Gruesome imagery e.g isis beheading videos and stuff like that</li>
            <li>Scams</li>
        </ul>
        <pre>
             Like any social media, twitter is full of viruses and scams. For example, just a few months 
             ago a lot of very large twitter accounts were hacked and they all sent out a similar message 
             along the lines of "im feeling genourous so whoever sends me money in bitcoin in the next 30mins 
             will get double sent back". They of course did not get their money back.
